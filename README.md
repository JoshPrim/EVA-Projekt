# EVA-Projekt

### Summery
This is the repository for the EVA project

The aim of this project is to develop a distributed application using the FaSTa API of Deutsche Bahn AG. 
The web application should provide information about the current operating status of each elevator and escalator at a train station of Deutsche Bahn. 
Users can thus quickly and easily convince themselves of the functionality of an elevator or escalator at their stop. 
In addition, statistics on the elevator systems and their downtimes are to be collected. 
These could be of great relevance both for interested users and for DB itself.
